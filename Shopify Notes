All about shopify
***Introduction***

Shopify is mostly Dynamic(Modularity). It refers to other things that needs to be implemented dynamically rather than working on static data.
Which provides flexibility and thus it will require logic base.

Designing, structuring and functioning of pages is ultimately similar to our old html, css and js way but it's just more user oriented(Flexible).


for e.g.(Just for basic idea, don't worry if you don't understand anything about schema)

in normal html element we use :
<img src='thispic.jpg' alt='apicture'>

but in shopify we will use section schema to obtain image from user and providing that schema an unique id and then refer your image source to that id:
<img src="{{block.settings.choosed-image}}" alt="{{block.settings.altText}}">

here structure of <img> element is same but the way image has been picked is a reference to the image picker schema


***Shopify Structure***
Since shopify is mostly about modularity, home come it's structure can't be modular.
Just as a normal website has multiple pages, shopify website also multiple pages on single website and the way there are structured are different.
It's like a container into another container inside of a container.
Outer most layer is theme layer which describes the basic(standard) struture of page, and a theme should include header and footer section on every page.
Layout is the second layer inside of theme, which could be changed according to the page, you can use same page layout on multiple pages with modularity.
    for instance a layout for product page is created, thus it can be used anywhere on the website, using layout-name.liquid on theme file.
Section is the third layer, it's inside Layout container, sections are block of codes that can be used in any layouts.
    collection of section is what makes a layout. like: grid section, list section, image slider section. (These are reusable(flexibility))
    for instance we have created a two column, two row grid of product and now we want to use it on two pages, then we just have to include this section inside any layout file
Snippets should not be considered as layer, there are more like a repeatable block of code which we do not want to write again and again, instead include them inside
snippet and call the snippet in any Section where you need it.
